# Roman Numeral Calculator

Start by writing a Roman Numeral converter and from that Roman Numerals. Then write a Roman Numeral Calculator that takes a string i.e. “XXIV + XI” and returns the result which would be “XXXV”. Ideally it should perform all BODMAS calculation so:

- Brackets: ()
- Order (power): ^
- Division: /
- Multiplication: *
- Addition: +
- Subtraction: -

## Assumptions

- Cannot represent values greater than or equal to 4000 in Roman Numerals using only characters I, V, X, L, C and M.
- Cannot represent fractions in Roman Numerals.
- Cannot represent zero in Roman Numerals.
